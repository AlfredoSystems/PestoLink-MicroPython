# PestoLink-MircoPython
*v1.0.0*

PestoLink-MicroPython is a MicroPython script designed to run on an XRP robot. If you upload these three files to an XRP robot, and run "main.py", you can then open the web app [PestoLink-Online](https://github.com/AlfredoSystems/PestoLink-Online), connect to your robot with BLE, and send gamepad data to the robot.

By default, this code will print a gamepads left y-axis, and try to drive the robots drivetrain based off of the left and right y-axis. This behavior can be changed in main.py

This script is a WIP. I intend to reformat it as an easier to use python module.
